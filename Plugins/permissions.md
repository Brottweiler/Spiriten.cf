# Permissions

Permissions plugins are one of the most important plugins on a server as they directly dictate what commands a player can or cannot do. If you are running a server, make sure
the permissions plugin you use is well performing, updated, and has no big exploits. A lot of servers still run on older/exploit filled systems which can impact the server as
a whole.

This list I am compiling here covers all of the different Minecraft Permissions Plugins I have encountered and links to them too.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A - Z

[APermissions](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/15726/) : APermissions is a permissions plugin with an in depth command system, a GUI for rank granting (with temporary options!),
and an open discord for support. It only supports 1.7.x to 1.14.x, but I still consider this better than some of the premium options listed here.

[ATOM](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/12801/) : ATOM is a premium permissions plugin with an ingame setup GUI and a /alts command to check other accounts under the same IP. The
GUI seems a bit slow to navigate and there are free plugins with this, but still a neat feature. Other than that, it's a bit of an average permissions plugin. It supports 1.7.10 and
1.8.x.

[Bedrock Player Management for Floodgate (Geyser)](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bedrock-player-managment-for-floodgate-geyser.82278/) : BPMFFG (for short) isn't a permissions
plugin on its own, rather an add-on for LuckPerms/Vault for adding groups/permissions depending on whether the player logged on using Bedrock edition or Java. It supports 1.8.x to
1.16.x.

[bPermissions](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/bpermissions) : bPermissions is a super old permissions plugin just like PermissionsBukkit (released a day after PermissionsBukkit on
in 2011) but has surprisingly modern features. It has inheritance, prefixes, promotion/demotion tracks, and even world support (better than some new permissions plugins). Considering
it has been updated recently too it wouldn't be a bad choice for its support 1.14.x - 1.16.x, however LuckPerms still has many features that bPermissions does not include yet.

[Bssentials GroupManager](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/bssentials-groupmanager) : BGM (for short) is a fork of Essentials Group Manager that was updated to (new at the time) 1.10.
It has most of the basic features you expect, but is abandoned with no support. Did I mention it need Bssentials installed to run? The explanation for everything is just a huge wall
of text too.

[BungeePerms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bungeeperms.25/) : BungeePerms is a permissions system designed for BungeeCord servers that can spread the permissions not only on the
BungeeCord server but also to the connected Spigot server. Other plugins like LuckPerms support this now I believe so it's a bit obsolete. BungeePerms claims to support 1.12.x to 1.16.x
but the reviews say that this is not true.

[GroupManager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/groupmanager.38875/) : GroupManager is a continuation of the old Bukkit GroupManager (not listing since this is the updated version)
with new features and optimizations. It has a pretty in-depth command system and even features like timed permissions that some plugins like UltraPermissions charge for. It supports
1.8.x to 1.16.x.

[LarryPerms2](https://github.com/Unix101/LarryPerms2) : LarryPerms2 is a fork of PermissionsEx 1.0 that I believe is just used for learning purposes and some optimizations. The GitHub
page states it is slow, untested, and hard to use in the readme.md.

[LightPerms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/62447/) : LightPerms is a very light weight permission plugin that works on 1.8 to 1.16. It has per player and and group permissions.

[LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/) : LuckPerms is the modern solution to permissions. It has a web editor which allows you to browse all permissions and your groups in an interface,
an active support discord, and constant updates patching out anything that may be considered a bug, improving performance, and adding new features along the way all while being free. 
It supports 1.7.x - 1.16.x. Go with LuckPerms if you are looking for a permissions plugin.

[My-Permissions](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/my-permissions) : My-Permissions is a permissions plugin thats basically just super barebones from what I can tell. It lacks a lot of 
features compared to LuckPerms basing off of the listed commands on the Bukkit page. It's also half the file size of the previously smallest permissions plugin I've seen before so I 
think it's safe to assume that it is likely very limited in ability. The good thing though is that it is actively updated and is for 1.16.x.

[Permission Manager](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/permission-manager) : Permission Manager is an abandoned now very limited permissions plugin. It has the some things like inheritance,
a per world system, and a rankup ladder but is missing things as basic as adding permissions to groups while ingame. It only supports up to 1.7.9 too.

[Permissions++](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/permissions-the-ultimate-permissions-plugin.70183/) : Permissions++ is a free permissions plugin. It has the basics, but not much from
there. It doesn't have too active of updates but it does have an open support discord. It supports 1.8.x to 1.16.x. Overall, a free and easy but pretty basical permissions plugin.

[PermissionsBukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/permbukkit) : PermissionsBukkit is a pretty simple and barebones permissions plugin, but it was one of the first. It doesn't support
newer versions (indefinitely stuck on 1.8.1) and has been abandoned, but it does what it needs to. It was also one of the first permissions plugins released on August 24, 2011 so it
gets some props for that. I would highly not recommend PermissionsBukkit just due to the extreme lack of features compared to even PermissionsEx 1.0 though.

[PermissionsEx 1.0](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/permissionsex) : PermissionsEx 1.0 is the old reigning permissions plugin, but fell off the charts due to unpatched bugs, an outdated
setup process, and bad support. It has various crash exploits throughout and most likely more to be found. Do not use PermissionsEx 1.0 unless you are running a server on older versions.

[PermissionsEx-1.23.x-Maintained](https://github.com/MiniDigger/PermissionsEx-1.23.x-Maintained) : PEX1.23M (for short) is an attempted fork at keeping PermissionsEx 1.0 stable and mainted.
Ironically, this "maintained" fork has been abandoned for years.

[PermissionsEx 2.0](https://permissionsex.stellardrift.ca/) : PermissionsEx 2.0 is an attempt to bring PermissionsEx back on the map, with (I believe) a full rewrite and new modern features
being added. It has an open support discord and frequent updates to the GitHub page, so I assume it is going good. It still lacks many features LuckPerms has brought me to expect and
it's performance ability may change.

[PermissionsPlus](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/permissionsplus-plugin-security-permissions-management.57747/) : PermissionsPlus (not to be confused with Permissions++) is actually
relatively nice. It has a permissions checker for commands, an ingame GUI for adding permissions, and a pretty in depth command system from what I can tell. It's not bad at all, but is
currently abandoned. It supports 1.7.x to 1.12.x.

[PEX](https://github.com/Cqle/PEX) : PEX is a fork of PermissionsEx 1.0 which seems to have attempted to add optimizations. This includes adding a-sync processes. Today it is abandoned.

[PowerfulPerms](https://github.com/gustav9797/PowerfulPerms) : As far as I know, PowerfulPerms was a premium permissions plugin on SpigotMC but was removed due to abandonement. It 
supported some things like timed ranks, but other than that was a generic permissions plugin. It supported 1.7.x - 1.12.x. 

[Ultra Permissions](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ultra-permissions.42678/) : UltraPermissions is a premium permissions manager with an ingame GUI for adding permissions along with some other
small features like adding permissions for specific amounts of time. Its a bit slow and complicated to head through the ingame menus and there are reports of it lagging the server while editing 
permissions, but that GUI can still be extremely useful... until you remember theres easier to use free alternatives. Ultra Permissions supports 1.8.x to 1.16.x.

[xPermissions](https://www.mc-market.org/threads/592984/) : xPermissions is a premium permissions plugin with pretty basic permissions editing - not even able to set a default group. It does
have an open support discord, but there are much better free alternatives.

[zPermissions](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/zpermissions.11736/) : zPermissions is "a beast" as said on the Spigot page. Despite this, it has not been updated for a year and all links
to pages explaining how to use the plugin lead to 404s. I can't recommend it due to this, despite it being "a beast". It does support 1.8.x to 1.13.x though.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Recommendations

So, what do I recommend you use? Honestly, just use [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/). It's free, simple to use, you can edit all of your groups permissions in your web browser, you can check
commands permissions nodes using Verbose, there's just so much. And active support too! It's likely to not get dropped soon and currently is the reigning king feature wise, so why not for the
grand price of $0.
