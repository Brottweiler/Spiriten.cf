# World Management

World Management plugins allow you to have more than 1 world (a overworld+nether+end combo) in a single server. They also commonly have features like custom
world generator support, custom flags, addons, and complete control over your worlds from ingame. 

This list I am compiling here covers all of the different World Management Plugins that I have encountered and links to them too.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A - Z

[Advanced Slime World Manager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advanced-slimeworldmanager.87209/) : ASWM (for short) is a fork of Slime World Manager aiming to
enhance the API and continually update (since Slime World Manager was abanadoned). It is very new but the creator updates his plugins often so theres hope it'll stay
updated. Just like Slime World Manager it uses a different world compression system, loads whole worlds into ram, and has support for external databases. Other than
the API and it being updated I see no differences, so read Slime World Manager on this list for more information.

[Async-WorldManager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/async-worldmanager-awm.58943/) : AWM (for short) is a completely async world management system (as the name
implies) made for fast world creation and loading times. It runs off of FAWE which is known for instability (even sometimes deleting whole chunks) so be cautious
if you use this. It supports world creation, importing, deleting, unloading, etc (basically Multiverse Core features). It supports 1.12.x - 1.16.x.

[BitsWorlds](spigotmc.org/resources/bitsworlds.76736/) : BitsWorlds is a world manager mainly focusing on the basics (creating worlds, cloning worlds, and deleting worlds)
with some features like world backups and logs that are pretty unique and nice to have. It's also entirely run through GUIs which is pretty nice. It supports 1.8.x -
1.15.x and is currently abandoned.

[Dimensify](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dimensify.58283/) : Dimensify is a relatively basic world management plugin with the basics (create worlds, delete worlds,
go to worlds, and unload worlds) with some actually really nice features (set default world, send other players to certain worlds, and create portals (not like linking
portals, rather walking through a portal to teleport to a set location)). It supports 1.11.x - 1.13.x and is abandoned.

[DimensionDoor](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/dimensiondoor) : DimensionDoor is a multiworld plugin from 2011 with pretty basic features (create worlds, delete worlds,
set world spawns, and teleport to worlds) with some neat stuff like world flags, world specific chats, and even setting texturepacks per world. The latest release supports
1.5 - 1.5.1 with the earliest supporting 1.0. A pretty neat abandoned piece of MC history.

[DoubleVerse](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/doubleverse-v1) : DoubleVerse is a world manager with just basic features (world creation, world deletion, renaming worlds,
and un/loading worlds). It supports 1.12.x only and was abandoned when the creator was banned off of Bukkit.org.

[DoubleVerse Revisted](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/doubleverse-revisted.52962/) : The spelling error in the name was not my fault, rather is the plugins name
on SpigotMC so I'm going with it. It's a continuation of Doubleverse that is exactly the same except for a way to lock the world you are in. What does that do? They
don't say. It also only supports 1.12.x and is currently abandoned.

[dWorldManager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/denizen-dworldmanager.29016/) : dWorldManager is a world manager entirely written in Denizen. It supports just the 
bare basics (creating worlds and unloading worlds). It's mainly just meant for anyone who wants to make a server entirely in Denizen. It only supports 1.10.x and has
been abandoned.

[EasyWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/easyworld.73677/) : EasyWorld is a world manager with (yet again) just really basic features. Theres world creation,
world loading, and teleporting to worlds. It supports 1.8.x to 1.12.x.

[ExtraWorlds](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/extraworlds.68612/) : ExtraWorlds offers mainly just basic features (creating worlds, deleting worlds, teleporting
to worlds (note: you can't even import worlds?)) with only a couple interesting features like per world inventory or world modifiers (I am assuming properties/flags?).
It currently only supports 1.14.x and is abandoned.

[gMultiWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/gmultiworld.64630/) : gMultiWorld is a world manager (as usual) with just the basics (world creation, world deletion,
world importing, teleport to worlds, and world spawns). Nothing really notable. It supports 1.12.x - 1.13.x and is abandoned.

[Hyperverse](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hyperverse-w-i-p.77550/) : Hyperverse is a world manager thats mainly basic features in its current state (creating
worlds, importing worlds, and un/loading worlds) with some neat features too. It includes custom world flags, nether & end portal linking, and world regeneration
even. It supports 1.14.x - 1.16.x in its current state but seems to be abandoned.

[JustWorlds](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%98%86-justworlds-%C2%BB-create-and-manage-worlds-easily.53792/) : JustWorlds is a world management plugin with just
and only the basics (create worlds, set world spawns, and teleport to worlds). It was abandoned when the developer started work on a rewrite, but the rewrite was never
released with the plugin sitting abandoned. It only supports 1.12.x.

[Multiverse 2](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/multiverse-core.390/) : Multiverse 2 is the modern day world management standard - and it was also one of the (if 
not the) first Bukkit multiworld plugins, starting on August 3rd 2011. It has a lot of addons, tons of world properties, per world gamemode, extensive commands, etc. 
Only problem? Today it gets infrequent updates with serious lag that will even crash servers some of the time. It supports 1.13.x - 1.16.x.

[Multiverse Reloaded](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/multiversereloaded.60161/) : This basically was someone seeing Multiverse 2 being one of the most downloaded
plugins and saying to themselves, "if I rip that off I could get some downloads!". It has just the bare basics (creating worlds, deleting worlds, importing worlds,
unloading worlds, and teleporting to worlds) and instantly got abandoned. It supports 1.8.x to 1.13.x.

[MultiWelt](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/multiwelt.10648/) : MultiWelt is a German world manager with just the bare basics (you can create worlds and teleport
to them, thats it). It has been long abandoned and doesn't have any supported versions listed.

[Multiworld](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiworld-v-2-0) : Multiworld is one of the first multiple worlds on a server plugins, starting back in 2011.
On its latest release (2016) it's actually a lot better than a lot of others on this list - supports the basics (world creation, teleporting, un/loading, setting world
spawns, and a couple more) as well as things like custom world flags, portal linking, and moving other players between worlds. Its latest version supports 1.9.x to 1.12.x
with their oldest supporting CraftBukkit 1337 (pre-release Minecraft). A classic part of Minecraft history.

[MultiWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/multiworld-%E2%84%99-only-german.82849/) : MultiWorld is a German world management plugin with extremely basic
functions. It can create worlds and delete worlds... thats it. It only supports 1.8.x - 1.16.x. Seems to be abandoned.

[MultiWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/multiworld.67747/) : Whats with world management plugins and copycat names? MultiWorld is pretty basic, with the basic
features (create worlds, import worlds, delete worlds, and teleport to worlds) with one unique feature: a command to see everyone in your current world. Not really too
useful but definitely cool. It only supports 1.14.x and is abandoned.

[MultiWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/multiworld.4598/) : MultiWorld is a 2015 plugin for world management. It has the general basic features (create worlds,
un/load worlds, delelte worlds, and set world spawns) as well as some uncommon features (like linking portals and the ability to set world flags). It doesn't list
what version it supports and is very much abandoned. People trying to install it on their modern servers are getting world wipes (why would you try that...).

[MyWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/myworld.3540/) : MyWorld supports just the basics (create worlds, clone worlds, and unload worlds) with nothing else. It
was made for 1.7.x - 1.8.x and is currently abandoned. 

[MyWorlds](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/myworlds.39594/) : MyWorlds is a world management plugin with actually a lot of built in features. This includes the
basics (creating worlds, deleting worlds, cloning worlds, etc) but also things like per world inventory, per world OP's, cross world portals, custom world properties,
extensive permissions, where players left a world at, and more. Honestly it's pretty impressive - and has been around for 4 years so not likely to be abandoned. It
supports 1.8.x to 1.16.x.

[RXWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%99%A6rxworld%E2%99%A6-world-manager-1-8x-up-to-1-13x-tgx.62849/) : RXWorld is a world management plugin with all of the
basics (create worlds, delete worlds, import worlds, teleport to worlds, set world spawns, world difficulties) with a backup system + backup loading system. It currently
supports 1.8.x to 1.13.x with no updates in sight.

[Simple Worlds](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/simple-worlds) : Simple Worlds is an older world management plugin with just the basic features (create worlds, delete
worlds, un/load worlds, and teleport to worlds). It only supported 1.6.4 and is very obviously abandoned.

[Slime World Manager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/slimeworldmanager.69974/) : SWM (for short) is a world manager that uses a different world compression system
for performance + using less storage, loads a whole world into ram at once (can be bad on large servers) for instant chunk loading, and support for external databases
for storage. It has commands to create worlds, clone worlds, delete worlds, unload worlds, etc. It seems like a pretty nice option - until you realize it will make your
world incompatible with other world management systems (including vanilla) and only supports 1.8.x to 1.14.x.

[Universes](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/universes.68067/) : Universes is a world management plugin with things likeworld properties, per world player counts, per 
group world spawns, things like per world inventories, and overrides for all of those. It supports 1.14.x to 1.16.x. Updates for it are pretty slow as it's made by a
single developer, but it is not currently abandoned.

[Universim](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%AD%90-universim-a-multiverse-plugin-sh99-universe-%E2%AD%90.70339/) : Universim is an extremely basic world manager with
only world creation, world un/loading, world teleports, and a GUI for managing some things like mob amounts. It supports 1.9.x - 1.15.x and is currently abandoned.

[Welten Manager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/welten-manager.61255/) : Welten Manager is a Germany world management plugin with the basic features (create worlds, 
delete worlds, teleport to worlds, and the ability to set world spawns) with a single neat (but potentially dangerous) feature: the ability to kill all mobs in a world. 
It only supports 1.8.x and is, of course, abandoned.

[Welt-Manager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/welt-manager-spigot-1-8-eol.71524/) : Welt-Manager is a German world management plugin with (yet again) just the basics. You
can create worlds, delete worlds, and teleport to worlds. That's... it. It only supports 1.8.x and is abandoned.

[World++](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/world.12542/) : World++ offers just the bare basics (create worlds, delete worlds, and teleport to worlds) without even any
supported versions listed. It has been long abandoned.

[WorldCreator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldcreator-1-8-1-15.78844/) : WorldCreator is a world management plugin with only basic features (world creation, world
importing, worl deletion, and world unloading). It supports 1.8.x - 1.15.x due to it being currently abandoned.

[WorldCreator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldcreator.14715/) : WorldCreator just has the bare basics (create worlds, delete worlds, and teleport to worlds) with
not even a supported version listed. It, obviously, has been abandoned.

[World Loader](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/world-loader.49253/) : World Loader is another world management plugin with mainly just basic features (create worlds,
delete worlds, un/load worlds, and teleport to worlds) with some neat features (like per world PvP toggles) which can all be done inside of a GUI. It supports 1.8.x to
1.12.x - and is currently abandoned.

[WorldMaker](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldmaker.43892/) : WorldMaker is a really simple world management plugin that allows you to create worlds, delete worlds,
and teleport to worlds. It supports 1.11.x - 1.12.x and is abandoned.

[World Manager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/world-manager.87365/) : Its definitely got the award for most basic name! It is a world management plugin with pretty
basic features. It can create worlds, unload worlds, and save worlds. It also might be abandoned already, 2 months without even any change to the place where the source 
code is hosted. It supports 1.8.x to 1.16.x.

[WorldManager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%97%95%E2%80%BF-%EF%BD%A1-worldmanager-%E2%8A%99%E2%96%BD%E2%8A%99-1-16-2-world-management-%E2%97%95-auto-backup-%E2%97%95-generators-%E2%97%95%E2%80%BF%E2%97%95.81081/) : 
WorldManager (yet again a super creative name! /s) with mainly just basic features (create worlds, import worlds, un/load worlds, etc). Only interesting things
I'm seeing is chatcolor support and a lot of permission nodes. It supports 1.15.x and 1.16.x.

[WorldManager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldmanager.60540/) : Third world manager I've found with the same name! Devs, please use names other than just the topic.
It'll make it a lot easier for people to find your plugin if they don't have a direct link as theres others with the exact same name. It supports the basics (creating worlds,
loading worlds, and deleting worlds) all inside of a GUI. Theres also some custom world properties you can edit in the GUI as well as setting default gamemodes per world. It
honestly seems kind of neat - but it has an extremely un-unique name and is abandoned, eternally supporting 1.13.x to 1.15.x. 

[Worldmanager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldmanager.61908/) : Worldmanager is a world management plugin with the ability to create worlds, teleport to them, and
"match more !". It supports 1.7.x to 1.13.x and is currently abandoned. I'd avoid either way, probably stolen code.

[WorldManager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldmanager.56799/) : WorldManager is a world management plugin with (yet again!) just the basics. You can create worlds,
delete worlds, rename worlds, unload worlds, and teleport to worlds. Why would you ever put in unique features? It supports 1.12.x - 1.14.x and is abandoned.

[WorldManager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldmanager.48340/) : WorldManager offers only the basics (create worlds, delete worlds, unload worlds, and teleport to
worlds) with the only notable feature being that it all works inside of a GUI. It supports 1.8.x to 1.12.x and, like most other plugins on this list, is abandoned.

[WorldManager+](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldmanager.12539/) : WorldManager+ has just the bare basics (create worlds, delete worlds, and teleport to worlds)
without supported versions even being listed. It has been long abandoned. Also want to note, it's just World++ rebranded, odd.

[WorldMania](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldmania-worldmanagment-gui-based-1-8-8-1-16x.83764/) : WorldMania is a pretty new world management plugin that
works through GUIs. It supports world creation, deletion, cloning, tp costs, and more - all managed inside of GUIs. Pretty useful and easy to use, especially for
beginner server owners. Sadly, it is no longer getting proper updates, only bug fixes. It supports 1.8.x to 1.16.x.

[World - / Project and Permissions Manager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/wpm-v1-0-world-project-and-permissions-manager.54906/) : WPPM (for short) is a world management
plugin with pretty basic features (create worlds and un/load worlds). The only kind of unique thing I saw was the ability to check which world you're in with a command. There
are also other purposes in this plugin like a "project manager" that prevents people from entering worlds they shouldn't, a warp system, and a perms manager that controls
projects (I think this plugins meant for build teams, I have no idea). It supports 1.8.x -  1.13.x and is currently abandoned.

[World Teleport](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/world-teleport.33045/) : World Teleport is an extremely simple world management plugin, only supporting world creation
and teleporting to worlds. It supports 1.8.x and is abandoned.

[World Tools](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/world-tools.34304/) : World Tools (just like almost every other plugin on this list) is just the basics (create worlds,
unload worlds, set world spawns, and teleport to worlds). It supports 1.9.x - 1.11.x and copied everyone else by abandoning their plugin.

[WorldX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldx-1-8-simple-world-management.88572/) : WorldX is a really new world management plugin thats really simple and limited.
It of course has world creation and teleportation, but other than that only have setting a worlds spawn. Also, do not rely on this plugin as the creator has a lot of
history creating plugins and just abandoning them - likely what'll happen with this. It supports only 1.8.x.

[wWorldCreator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/wworldcreator.80823/) : wWorldCreator is an extremely basin world management plugin with only the options to create
worlds and teleport to them. It supports 1.7.x - 1.11.x.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Recommendations

Honestly, you can't really go wrong with [Multiverse 2](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/multiverse-core.390/). It's not likely to stop updating and has pretty much
all features you'd expect now (and probably more). It also has quite a few addons meaning you likely will get what you need out of it. Sadly, it does lack some performance
and has quite a bit of unpatched bugs.

If you've had issues with Multiverse or it's just a bit overwhelming, I'd recommend
[WorldMania](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldmania-worldmanagment-gui-based-1-8-8-1-16x.83764/). It still has really in depth world management but provides
a really nice and easy to use GUI interface for setup/usage. It's not really being updated in its current state so the developer can work on some other projects, but
still should be a solid experience.
