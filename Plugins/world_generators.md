# World Generators

One of the most sought after plugin types for new server creators are World Generators. 
A World Generator alters the way that a Minecraft World is generated, making gameplay and player experience different.
Minecraft World Generators all operate with the same idea but with different code, leading to different performance, looks, and even accessibility.

This list I am compiling here covers all of the different Minecraft World Generators I have encountered and links to them too.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A - Z

[173generator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/b173gen) : 173generator is an abandoned free generator made to create Beta 1.7 looking terrain. The last version of it released 
supports 1.13.

[AeroGen](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/aerogen) : AeroGen is a skyworld generator that I believe is meant to recreate the Aether. It was abandoned in 2012, last supporting
version 1.2.4.

[Aether Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/aether-generator.65845/) : Aether Generator is a recreation of the Aether mod as the name suggests. It spawns the sky
islands, dungeons, houses, loot chests, and various biomes. Just note - it does not make the glowstone portal work. There were people giving bad reviews due to not knowing
how to work a world generator, building up the classic Aether portals. It does seem abandoned and supports 1.8.x to 1.15.x.

[AlmostFlatLandsReloaded](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/almostflatlandsreloaded-1-7-1-16.55405/) : AFLR (for short) is a free and open source generator that does what it 
says, generating an almost flatworld with some terrain height variation, trees, tall grass, etc. It is most useful for Creative / Building servers or possibly HCF.

[AMazeGen](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/amazegen) : AMazeGen is a maze generator plugin for 1.8.x - 1.13.x. I have no idea what it looks like, but it is abandoned today.

[AncientCave](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/acientcave) :: AncientCave is a randomly generated dungeon plugin. It was abandoned in 2013, last supporting 1.4.6.

[ASkyGrid](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/askygrid.36436/) : ASkyGrid is a recreation of the classic SethBling SkyGrid mod for Bukkit. It is abandoned, supporting only 
1.8.x = 1.12.x. It also has built in challenges, I think it's meant to be a SkyBlock replacement.

[AtlasWorldGen](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/atlasworldgen) : AWG (for short) is a world generator that just spawns rolling hills, huts, and lakes. I have no idea what it
looks like but do know that it's abandoned, last supporting 1.2.5.

[Beta+ Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/beta-bukkit) : Beta+ Bukkit is a world generator meant to bring back Beta 1.7.3 terrain generation. It was abandoned in early
2020, last supporting 1.14.x.

[BetterEnd](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/betterend-rethink-the-end-dimension.79389/) : BetterEnd is a free (and 
[premium](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/betterend-premium-rethink-the-end-dimension-again.81158/)) custom world generator for the end. It is completely open source (even 
the Premium version!) made by the developer of Terra. It has reached EOL and will be incorporated in a Terra config pack eventually, but it still is an amazing plugin to 
redefine the end dimension.

[BioMan](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/bioman) : BioMan is the original biome swapping plugin, starting back in 2012. It's pretty limited but still neat. It is abandoned,
last supporting 1.5.2.

[Biome Bundle](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/biome-bundle.51374/) : Biome Bundle is a free configuration pack for 
[Open Terrain Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/open-terrain-generator-otg.51373/) boasting over 400 biomes and over 2000 structures. It 
isn't actively updated, but is still arguably the best generator for 1.12.

[Biome Remap](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/biome-remap.70973/) : Biome Remap is a free generator which alters things like the temperature of biomes, letting ice and snow
to form in deserts. It supports 1.14.x to 1.16.x.

[BiomeReplacer](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1-8-8-1-16-5-biomereplacer-biomeswap-replace-unfamiliar-biomes.81080/) : BiomeReplacer is basically a copy of Biome Remap
with support from 1.8.8 - 1.16.5 added.

[Canyon World Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/canyon-world-generator-1-13-1-14-4.65147/) : CWG (for short) is a really beautiful world generator that will spawn
a world of just a mesa biome with giant rivers heading through. It only supports 1.13.x to 1.14.x in its abandoned state though.

[Castle World Generator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/castle-wars) : CWG (for short) is a pretty basic generator mainly creating hilly terrain with pretty commonly spawning
towers. Personally, not my favorite, but may be in your interest. It is abandoned, last supporting version 1.4.2.

[CityWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cityworld.2250/) : CityWorld is an abandoned 1.13 free and open source world generator that generates an endless city. It 
generates the buildings, roads, sewers, terrain, and more. It even has multiple different built in themes for the generation, and as far as I am aware it is vanilla friendly.

[CleanroomGenerator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/cleanroomgenerator) : CleanroomGenerator is a world generator meant to generate flat (or even empty) terrain. It supports
1.13.x - 1.16.x.

[Conurbation](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/conurbation) : Conurbation is the predecessor to [CityWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cityworld.2250/), providing more
basic generation. It was abandoned in 2012, last supporting version 1.2.3.

[Crazy Generation](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/crazy-generation.84294/) : Crazy Generation is a world generator that generates some "crazy" biomes. It seems like a pretty
small project without much in it, still neat. It supports 1.12.x.

[CustomWorldGenerator](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/4930/) : CustomWorldGenerator is a premium world generator that supports complete configurability meant for HCF/KitPvP
maps. Sadly, it is apparently extremely hard to configure and seems to have been abandoned. It supports 1.7.x to 1.12.x.

[CyberWorld Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/inactive-cyberworld-generator.36101/) : CyberWorld Generator is a free and open source futuristic city generator. It 
is currently abandoned and quite slow, but can still be potentially useful.

[Dann's Oasis Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/danns-world-generator-oasis-desert-demo-1-14-x-1-15-x-uses-an-organic-tree-generator.74083/) : DOG (for short) is a 
free world generator like nothing I've seen before. It is an Oasis generator (as implied) and manages to do that perfectly. It ever organically generates trees, it's one of the
few generators I've even seen do that. Despite the amazing generation, it lacks constant updates and also some more performance out of the generator is desirable.

[DefaultGenerator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/defaultgenerator) : DefaultGenerator is a world generator that just generates the vanilla generation for all 3 dimensions.
Why? It's to mix into a plugin called [MetaGenerator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/metagenerator) which allows you to mix world generators in a single world. Sadly, they're
both abandoned, only supporting 1.7.9.

[Dungeon Maze](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/dungeon-maze) : Dungeon Maze is a world generator meant to generate an infinite explorable dungeon. It looks pretty cool, an
endless fight/exploration. Sadly, it was abandoned in 2018 (it began in 2012, lasted for 6 years!) last supporting 1.9.x - 1.12.x.

[Dwarven Delight](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/dwarven-delight) : Dwarven Delight is a world generator meant to transform your world to a more miner friendly experience. It
makes the top world very boring and basic an makes the underground much deeper with things like silverfish nests. It was abandoned in 2012, last supporting 1.3.1.

[EpicNetherGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/epicnethergenerator-ewg-add-on-%E2%9D%97%EF%B8%8Fsale-%E2%9D%97%EF%B8%8F-50-off.25678/) : ENG (for short) is a premium
custom Nether generator addon for EpicWorldGenerator... with all of the same issues. It is slow, has tons of bugs (including corruptions), has slow support, and is ran by devs
who have no idea what their code does. AVOID.

[EpicWorldGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/epicworldgenerator-1-15-1-16-5.8067/) : EWG (for short) is a premium world generator with a cult following. It's
commonly referred to as the best looking world generator, but that idea is broken down when you realize that it is a broken mess based off of a 1.6 Forge mod called
Realistic World Generator (unrelated to the Spigot one). EWG has tons of bugs, infrequent updates, and confused devs who have no idea what they're doing since it is
based off of stolen code.

[Eternal Ice](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/eternal-ice) : Eternal Ice is a world generator meant to generate ice/snow worlds. It looks nice, but was abandoned in 2012, last
supporting version 1.2.5.

[Experimental Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/experimental-generator.65755/) : Experimental Generator is a 1.8.x generator that looks very similar to Vanilla
generation with small tweaks - and floating islands above? Keep in mind, this was just an experimental thing so it is abandoned today.

[Experimental Generator - 2D](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/experimental-generator-2d.65762/) : EG2D (for short) is a world generator that spawns your world in 2D,
basically just stretching along one X+Y. As it was just an experiment it was abandoned quickly, only supporting 1.8.x.

[ExtremeTerrain](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/extremeterrain) : ExtremeTerrain is a world generator that basically just makes huge blobs of biomes in the sky. It looks quite
a bit messy in my opinion. It's abandoned, last supporting 1.11.x - 1.12.x.

[FactionsWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%9C%A8-factionsworld-%E2%9C%A8-perfect-factions-terrain.80454/) : FactionsWorld is a premium world generator meant to
generate relatively flat terrain, ideal for PvP based gamemodes like Factions. It supports 1.8.x to 1.16.x.

[Farlander](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/farlander) : Farlander is a world generator that generates... the far lands? I didn't know that was something people wanted. It was
abandoned in 2014, last supporting 1.7.2 - 1.8.x.

[Fjord](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/fjord) : Fjord is a world generator meant to recreate Scandinavia in Minecraft. It's really nice and something I'd like to try out -
but it was abandoned in 2013 last supporting 1.6.4.

[FlatGrass](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/flatgrass-4-1-0) : FlatGrass is a flat world generator with world creation features built in. It was abandoned in 2012 with no
downloads available.

[FlatLand](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/flatland) : FlatLand is a pretty basic flat world generator. Not much to note. It is currently abandoned, last supporting version
1.3.2.

[FlatlandsBuilder](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/flatlandsbuilder) : FlatlandsBuilder is a flat world generator with customizations like height and blocks used. It is
abandoned, last supporting 1.6.4.

[FlatSurvival](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/flatsurvival) : FlatSurvival is a flag world generator with things like flowers, trees, water pools, and structures. It's
pretty neat, although I'm not sure how useful. It was abandoned in 2012, last supporting version 1.3.2.

[FlatWorldGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/flatworldgenerator.80344/) : It... does exactly what it's named. It generates flat worlds with some configurable
options. It supports 1.8.x - 1.15.x.

[Floating Island World Generator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/floating-island-world-generation) : FIWG (for short) is a world generator meant to recreate the Minecraft
Sky Dimension that was teased around when the Nether was introduced. It has dungeons, villages, and a bunch of different biomes that spawn. It is abandoned, last supporting
1.8.x.

[FloatingIsles](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/floating-isles) : FloatingIsles is a world generator that just generates small floating islands. It was abandoned in 2012,
last supporting 1.4.2.

[Galaxy World](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/galaxy-world) : Galaxy World is a floating island world generator that actually looks really nice with half spherical islands.
It was sadly abandoned in 2015, last supporting 1.8.x. That's pretty sad as honestly it looks really cool and like a neat challenge.

[Giant Caves](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/giant-caves.29758/) : Giant Caves is a plugin that generates vanilla terrain on the surface with... giant caves below.
I will note, its actually pretty similar to the 1.17 cave update - its really cool. You can configure the sizes of the caves which is pretty neat. There are complaints of
extreme lag during pregeneration though. It only officially supports 1.10.x in its current abandoned state.

[GlowWorld](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/glowworld) : GlowWorld is a pretty basic world generator that just generates mounds of glowstone. It also has loot chests and
glowstone structures I think. I don't see the appeal of solid glowstone generation personally, but maybe you do. It supports version 1.2.5 as it was abandoned back in 2012.

[GTSphereWorld](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/gtsphereworld) : GTSW (for short) is a world generator that apparently just generates a world of floating spheres. There are no
images provided so I have no idea what it looks like. It was last updated in 2016, supporting 1.8.1.

[HothGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hothgenerator.4819/) : HothGenerator is a free world generator aimed at recreating the Hoth planet from the Star
Wars movies. It was abandoned in 2016 with no supported versions listed.

[HothGeneratorReload](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/exit.69108/) : HothGeneratorReload is a fork of HothGenerator meant to continually update it and add new features
(including custom crafts and new structures). It supports 1.13.x - 1.14.x. Sadly, it's been abandoned today.

[Iris World Gen](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/iris-world-gen-the-dimension-engine.84586/) : IWG (for short) is basically a newer and better EWG. It has phemonenal looks 
and supports full configuration, but has lots of fallbacks that you should not get from a premium plugin. This includes infrequent updates, many bugs, and really slow 
performance.

[IslandCraft](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/islandcraft) : IslandCraft is a free but abandoned legacy (1.12 and below) world generator that spawns biomes on islands across 
an infinite ocean.

[Islands](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/island-generator) : Islands is a world generator that spawns, well, islands. Not really any large patches of land and instead just 
spread out islands. It's pretty cool, but was abandoned in 2012, last supporting version 1.3.2.

[iWorld](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/iworld) : iWorld is a really basic world generator just meant to be an alternative to the default. It really looks like just a tall
hill generator from what I can see. It was abandoned in 2012, last supporting version 1.2.5.

[Junkyard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/junkyard) : Junkyard is a world generator that just spawns hills of random blocks from what I can tell. This is to make a junkyard
look for "those of us who are too lazy to craft". Sounds like it's a bit ugly, no clue though as there are no images provided and I am not launching up a 1.4.5 server.

[Lightweight Void Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lwvg.89557/) : LWVG (for short) is a free and super lightweight world generator that'll just spawn a void.
Does exactly what it says. It supports 1.8.x - 1.16.x.

[Logaaan's World Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/logaaans-world-generator.62550/) : This was an experimental world generator with a pretty basic top area and
an underworld underneath. It only supports 1.13.x and seems abandoned.

[MagicWorlds](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/magicworlds) : MagicWorlds is an addition to the popular [Magic](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/magic) plugin that adds a mystical
world with Magic items spawning in. It is abandoned but last supported 1.9.x - 1.14.x.

[MarsGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/marsgenerator.76952/) : MarsGenerator is a free world generator which basically just spawns red sand hills. Not really much
to it. It supports 1.14.x and is abandoned.

[MaxiWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/maxiworld.11124/) : MaxiWorld is a world generator that basically just multiplies everything by 8, making each block that would
usually be 1 block be 8x8x8. Not really that useful, but still cool. It supports 1.13.x.

[ModifiedGen](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/modifiedgen.34504/) : ModifiedGen is a world generator that allows you to prevent certain biomes from spawning. It supports
1.7.x - 1.11.x and is currently abandoned.

[MojaveWorld](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/ldapocalypse) : MojaveWorld is an apocalypse world generator from the looks of you. You get no grass, limited wood, and no water
and have to find a way to survive. It seems interesting, but is abandoned. It last supports version 1.5.2.

[MoonGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/moongenerator.62432/) : MoonGenerator is an extremely simple generator just making hills out of endstone. Cool test, not
really a proper world generator. It supports 1.13.x.

[MoonGenerator 2](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/moon-generator-2.63771/) : MoonGenerator 2 is a continuation of MoonGenerator with also basic hills of endstone. It
has ore veins, rockets, mob spawning support, and more though - not really focusing on the world generator portion. It supports 1.16.x.

[Nether FlatLands](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/nether-flatlands-terain-generato) : Nether FlatLands is a custom Nether generator that generates a relatively flat nether,
with just some portions. Not too sure what it looks like as there's only 1 picture. It only supports 1.2.5.

[Nordic](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/banananordic) : Nordic is actually a really cool world generator meant to create a Nordic type of feel. It honestly looks amazing
in my opinion but was sadly abandoned in 2016, leaving it to only support 1.8.1. If only there was a reload...

[NordicReload](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/exit.69242/) : NordicReload is a continuation of the original Nordic world generator. It is the same thing but supporting newer
versions... 1.14.x that is as it has been abandoned for a year. Sad as it looks AMAZING.

[OldGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/oldgenerator-1-16-4.86600/) : OldGenerator is a fork of 173generator to bring Beta 1.7 generation to modern versions. It 
performs well and does what it needs, although there are reports of generation errors.

[OneHundredGenerator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/onehundredgenerator) : OHG (for short) is a world generator that just generates Version 1.0 worlds to keep world
compatibility in the future. Ironically, it was never updated to support anything past 1.0.1 so its purpose could never come into play. It is of course abandoned today.

[Open Terrain Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/open-terrain-generator-otg.51373/) : OTG (for short) is a free port to Spigot of the infamous Forge mod. It allows 
for complete control over world  generation, as long as you're using legacy versions as it has been abandoned. It is a fork of 
[TerrainControl](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/terraincontrol.2214/).

[Paradise Generator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/paradise) : Paradise Generator is a world generator with claims of generating "lots of tress, deep seas, cliffs, snowy
mountains, grass and flowers" (the trees spelling mistake was from them). The only photo provided just shows a snowy area. It was abandoned in 2014, supporting 1.7.4.

[Paradise Island](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/paradise-land-1-8-8-1-16-x-skyworld-generator.28056/) : Paradise Island is a premium Aether generator but yet lacks 
everything you expect from a premium plugin. It is slow and laggy, has a lack of support, limited features, and is infrequently updated.

[PermaWorldGenerator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/permaworldgenerator) : PWG (for short) is a fork of 
[OneHundredGenerator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/onehundredgenerator) with the exact same purpose (to continuously generate your world in 1.0 generation no matter if 
updates change generation) but with additional changes like structures removed, some underground generations removed, and lowered amounts of ores. Just like OHG it was abandoned 
only supporting 1.0.1.

[Pheonix Terrain](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/phoenix-terrain) : Pheonix Terrain is a world generator plugin meant to provide complete customizability. It was abandoned in
2011, last supporting CraftBukkit 1317 (I think thats 1.4.2). It was continued with TerrainControl.

[Planetoids](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/planetoids-minecraft-planet-generator-configure-every-planet-terrain-ores-and-structures.74537/) : Planetoids is a premium
world generator that just sort of pastes spheres and puts trees on top? I guess it's meant to look like many planets, but just looks like someone had fun with WorldEdit to
me. There have been complaints over bad performance too. It supports 1.13.x to 1.16.x.

[PlethPack SkyGrid World Generator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/skygrid) : PPSGWG (for short) is a recreation of the SethBling SkyGrid mod in Bukkit. It's just that, nothing
special. It was abandoned in 2012, supporting version 1.4.2.

[PromisedLand](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/promisedland.70884/) : PromisedLand is a plugin meant to generate sky islands like the Minecraft Sky Dimension. It is abandoned
today with support for only 1.13.x - 1.14.x. Sad as it actually looks really nice.

[ProVoidWorld](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/provoidworld) : ProVoidWorld is a void world generator for 1.8.x - 1.12.2 that was abandoned in early 2020. Not much else to say.

[ProWorldGenerator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/proworldgenerator) : ProWorldGenerator is a flat world generator for 1.12.x. I have no more info.

[pTerrain](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/hx1-pt) : pTerrain is a flat world generator with questionable default settings (like glowstone on the surface level, what... ?) but
complete customizability. It is abandoned though, last updated for version 1.2.3 in 2012.

[PTM173](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/ptm173) : PTM173 is another world generator meant to generate Beta 1.7.3 terrain. It was abandoned in 2012, last supporting version 1.1.

[RealisticNetherGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/realisticnethergenerator.40846/) : RNG (for short) is a premium Nether generator by the same people as RWG. It
has the same issues of being very slow and seems to be abandoned at the moment with many bugs, only supporting 1.8.x - 1.16.x.

[RealisticWorldGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/realisticworldgenerator-1-8-8-1-16-x.15905/) : RWG (for short) is a premium world generator based on providing a 
realistic experience. Despite this, it is basically a very slow hill generator that pastes in schematics by default, although you can create your own configuration. 

[SB-Skylands](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/sb-skylands.24253/) : SB-Skylands is a fork of SkylandsPlus+ to update it to 1.8.x. - 1.11.x. It stays faithful to SkylandsPlus+
all while adding optimizations and configuarability. Sadly, it has been abandoned.

[Scatman's World](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/scatmans-world.81023/) : Scatman's World is a free world generator made to recreate the depicted world from the Scatman's
World music video. It's a joke generator but still pretty cool. It supports 1.15.x - 1.16.x.

[SecondNature](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/secondnature-advanced-forest-generator.65639/) : SecondNature is an attachment to the default world generator which reworks
how forests spawn with "random and organic forest generation". Honestly, it looks really nice and would be a great addon - if it weren't abandoned only supports 1.14.x - 1.15.x.

[Sewers](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/sewers) : Sewers is a world generator meant to add sewers underground, mainly for city build servers. It started back in 2011 and was
abandoned in 2013, last supporting 1.5.2.

[ShipwreckedWorldGen](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/shipwreckedworldgen) : SWG (for short) is a world generator meant to turn your world into islands to look more
shipwrecked. It is very basic and was abandoned in 2013, last supporting 1.6.2.

[SkygridGenerator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/skygridgenerator) : SkygridGenerator is another recreation of SethBling's SkyGrid mod in Bukkit. It's just that, only
supporting version 1.4.7.

[SkyGridMaker](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/skygridmaker) : SkyGridMaker is another recreation of SethBling's SkyGrid mod in Bukkit. Nothing really else to it. It was
abandoned in 2012, only supporting 1.2.5.

[SkylandsPlus+](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/skylandsplus) : SkylandsPlus+ is a free world generator mimicing the Minecraft Sky Dimension. It's pretty nice but has been 
abandoned for 8 years now, last supporting 1.6.2.

[SkyRider](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/skyrider) : As far as I am aware, this is a world generator that's sort of like the end? It spawns grassy endstone islan ds with
stone, wool monoliths, and trees with enderman. It was abandoned in 2012, last supporting 1.4.5.

[SkyStone](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/skystone) : SkyStone is a world generator that spawns floating islands with 50 different biomes. It looks really cool, but was
abandoned in 2014 - last supporting version 1.7.4.

[SkyWorld](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/skyworld) : SkyWorld is sort of an Aether replica for Bukkit as far as I am aware. Not much is known as it was posted in 2011, when
compatible versions weren't even required to be listed.

[Stony Hills](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/stony-hills) : Stony Hills is a world generator that just spawns hills made out of mainly stone materials. It is abandoned and only
supports 1.14.x.

It's pretty new to the market but has a good developer
actively supporting the generator. It's fully configurable, but it may run into some performance issues.

[Subterranea](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/subterranea) : Subterranea is a world generator that generates a vanilla above ground world with a custom underground world. It
has underground biomes, things like silverfish colonies, and makes the underground 3x deeper. It's really cool, I just wish it was updated. It was abandoned in 2014, last
supporting 1.7.9.

[Super Build Land](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/super-build-land) : Super Build Land is a world generator that just generates flat worlds that don't spawn slimes. It was
abandoned in 2012, last supporting version 1.2.5.

[SuraPlanets](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/suraplanets-world-generation-plugin.80052/) : SuraPlanets is a free world generator meant to recreate the Planetoids generator
for free. It doesn't really look the same to me (doesn't spawn grass/foliage often and doesn't paste in trees) but atleast it's free and supports 1.16.x.

[TallNether](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/tallnether.22561/) : TallNether is a world generator that preserves all aspects of vanilla generation for the Nether - except
instead of it having a roof at 128 blocks it gets a roof at 256 blocks. This allows you to have a much more open feeling Nether. It currently supports 1.8.x to 1.16.x.

[Terra](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/terra.85151/) : Terra is a free and open source world generator with almost vanilla generation speeds and complete configurability. It 
has built in scripting, configuration tools, and an active community working on configuration packs. A free world generator with this many features, active support, and 
consistent updates is unheard of before.

[TerraformGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/terraformgenerator-alpha.75132/) : TerraformGenerator is not the fastest or best looking generator, but it is free and 
open source. It updates frequently, but support may be limited.

[TerrainControl](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/terraincontrol.2214/) : TerrainControl is a free world generator allowing you to control all aspects of world generation. You
can change biome sizes, add custom biomes, control the actual generation (horizontal + vertical), and more. Sadly, its complicated and a bit laggy. It also has been abandoned,
only supporting 1.9.x. It is a fork of [Pheonix Terrain](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/phoenix-terrain).

[TerrainVersionChanger](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/terrainversionchanger) : TVC (for short) allows you to use the generation from absolutely any version just by providing
the .jar file. It's actually really interesting, I'm now wondering what would happen if you would use a newer jar with it. Anyways, it was sadly abandoned in 2015 with no
publically available downloads.

[The Dungeonator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/dungeonator) : The Dungeonatpr is an infinite dungeon generator with Labyrinth type generation. It has been abandoned though,
last updated for 1.0.1 in 2011.

[Trippy Terrain](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/trippy-terrain) : Trippy Terrain is a world generator with 5 different options: flat world, water world, a void world, pancake
world (floating layers of grass), and khyland (no idea). It was abandoned in 2011, created for CraftBukkit 1337 (no idea what version that is).

[Tropic](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/tropic) : Tropic is a tropical world generator that was abandoned in 2012, last updated to version 1.2.5. It's really sad as this is one
of the type of themes I like to see most in world generators.

[ToTheMoon](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/tothemoon.60390/) : ToTheMoon is a moon generator with pretty basic hills of endstone. It does have ores that spawn and custom
crafts though, not too great of a world generator alone sadly. It supports 1.8.x to 1.12.x.

[UHCBiomeReplacer PRO](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/uhcbiomereplacer-pro.84514/) : UHCBRP (for short) is a world generator that just generates forests instead of oceans
and ice cold biomes to make it a better experience for UHCs. It supports 1.7.x - 1.8.x.

[Ultimate SkyGrid](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/ultimate-skygrid) : Ultimate SkyGrid was the first Bukkit recreation of the classic SethBling mod SkyGrid. It was created
back in 2013 with its last update being in 2016, obviously abandoned forever supporting 1.9.x. It supports all 3 dimensions with quite a bit of customization.

[Underdark](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/underdark) : Underdark is a world generator meant to bring Dungeon & Dragons Underdark to Minecraft. It was abandoned in 2013,
last supporting 1.6.2.

[VacuumFlatgrass](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vacuum-flatgrass) : VacuumFlatgrass is a flatworld generator plugin with customizable heights and blocks used. It was 
abandoned in 2012, last supporting 1.2.3.

[Vast Tracks 'o Mountain](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vast-tracks-o-mountain) : VToM (for short) is a world generate that just generates extreme mountain terrain. Looks
more like a test generator than anything someone would use on a production server to me. It is abandoned, last supporting 1.3.1.

[VNetherGenerator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vnethergenerator) : VNetherGenerator is a relatively basic Nether generator with some new additions like new structures,
mushroom forests, netherwart patches, and ore spawning. It was abandoned in 2012, last supporting version 1.3.2.

[VoidGenerator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/voidgenerator) : VoidGenerator is a 2011 plugin that does what it says... it generates void worlds. It is abandoned, last
supporting version 1.0.1 (WOW!).

[Void Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/void-generator-1-15.73444/) : Void Generator is a world generator that just generates an empty world. Just generates a
void world. It supports 1.15.x.

[VoidRoomGenerator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/voidroomgenerator) : VoidRoomGenerator is yet another void generator plugin. It was abandoned in 2013, only supporting 1.7.2.

[VoidWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/voidworld.75504/) : VoidWorld is a world generator that as its name suggests just generates a void world. It supports 1.15.x -
1.16.x.

[VoidWorldGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/voidworldgenerator.55406/) : VoidWorldGenerator is a void generator supporting 1.8.x - 1.15.x. Nothing else to really
say, can't really mess this up.

[WellWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/wellworld.11125/) : WellWorld is a free world generator that generates a world divided up into regions, like in the book series
Well World. It's not really ideal for survival at all but is a pretty cool project/idea. It only supports 1.13.x.

[Wildlands](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wildlands) : Wildlands is the sequel to Biome Bundle. It offers even better looking terrain maintaining the Spigot
compatibility using OpenTerrainGenerator. It supports only 1.12.x.

# Recommendations

Out of all of the World Generators listed here, I would recommend [Terra](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/terra.85151/) for modern versions of the game, and if you're running 
a legacy server I would recommend [Open Terrain Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/open-terrain-generator-otg.51373/) with 
[Wildlands](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wildlands) due to performance and quality.
