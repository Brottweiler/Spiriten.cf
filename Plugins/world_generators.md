# World Generators

One of the most sought after plugin types for new server creators are World Generators. 
A World Generator alters the way that a Minecraft World is generated, making gameplay and player experience different.
Minecraft World Generators all operate with the same idea but with different code, leading to different performance, looks, and even accessibility.

This list I am compiling here covers all of the different Minecraft World Generators I have encountered and links to them too.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A - Z

[173generator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/b173gen) : 173generator is an abandoned free generator made to create Beta 1.7 looking terrain. The last version of it released supports 1.13.

[Aether Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/aether-generator.65845/) : Aether Generator is a recreation of the Aether mod as the name suggests. It spawns the sky
islands, dungeons, houses, loot chests, and various biomes. Just note - it does not make the glowstone portal work. There were people giving bad reviews due to not knowing
how to work a world generator, building up the classic Aether portals. It does seem abandoned and supports 1.8.x to 1.15.x.

[AlmostFlatLandsReloaded](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/almostflatlandsreloaded-1-7-1-16.55405/) : AFLR (for short) is a free and open source generator that does what it says, generating an almost flatworld with
some terrain height variation, trees, tall grass, etc. It is most useful for Creative / Building servers or possibly HCF.

[BetterEnd](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/betterend-rethink-the-end-dimension.79389/) : BetterEnd is a free (and [premium](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/betterend-premium-rethink-the-end-dimension-again.81158/)) custom world generator for the end. It is completely open source (even the Premium version!)
made by the developer of Terra. It has reached EOL and will be incorporated in a Terra config pack eventually, but it still is an amazing plugin to redefine the end dimension.

[Biome Bundle](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/biome-bundle.51374/) : Biome Bundle is a free configuration pack for [Open Terrain Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/open-terrain-generator-otg.51373/) boasting over 400 biomes and over 2000 structures. It 
isn't actively updated, but is still arguably the best generator for 1.12.

[Canyon World Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/canyon-world-generator-1-13-1-14-4.65147/) : CWG (for short) is a really beautiful world generator that will spawn
a world of just a mesa biome with giant rivers heading through. It only supports 1.13.x to 1.14.x in its abandoned state though.

[CityWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cityworld.2250/) : CityWorld is an abandoned 1.13 free and open source world generator that generates an endless city. It generates the buildings, 
roads, sewers, terrain, and more. It even has multiple different built in themes for the generation, and as far as I am aware it is vanilla friendly.

[CustomWorldGenerator](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/4930/) : CustomWorldGenerator is a premium world generator that supports complete configurability meant for HCF/KitPvP
maps. Sadly, it is apparently extremely hard to configure and seems to have been abandoned. It supports 1.7.x to 1.12.x.

[CyberWorld Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/inactive-cyberworld-generator.36101/) : CyberWorld Generator is a free and open source futuristic city generator. It is currently abandoned and quite slow, but 
can still be potentially useful.

[Dann's Oasis Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/danns-world-generator-oasis-desert-demo-1-14-x-1-15-x-uses-an-organic-tree-generator.74083/) : DOG (for short) is a free world generator like nothing I've seen before. It is an Oasis generator (as implied) and 
manages to do that perfectly. It ever organically generates trees, it's one of the few generators I've even seen do that. Despite the amazing generation, it lacks constant updates and 
also some more performance out of the generator is desirable.

[EpicWorldGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/epicworldgenerator-1-15-1-16-5.8067/) : EWG (for short) is a premium world generator with a cult following. It's
commonly referred to as the best looking world generator, but that idea is broken down when you realize that it is a broken mess based off of a 1.6 Forge mod called
Realistic World Generator (unrelated to the Spigot one). EWG has tons of bugs, infrequent updates, and confused devs who have no idea what they're doing since it is
based off of stolen code.

[Experimental Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/experimental-generator.65755/) : Experimental Generator is a 1.8.x generator that looks very similar to Vanilla
generation with small tweaks - and floating islands above? Keep in mind, this was just an experimental thing so it is abandoned today.

[Experimental Generator - 2D](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/experimental-generator-2d.65762/) : EG2D (for short) is a world generator that spawns your world in 2D,
basically just stretching along one X+Y. As it was just an experiment it was abandoned quickly, only supporting 1.8.x.

[Floating Island World Generator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/floating-island-world-generation) : FIWG (for short) is a world generator meant to recreate the Minecraft
Sky Dimension that was teased around when the Nether was introduced. It has dungeons, villages, and a bunch of different biomes that spawn. It is abandoned, last supporting
1.8.x.

[Giant Caves](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/giant-caves.29758/) : Giant Caves is a plugin that generates vanilla terrain on the surface with... giant caves below.
I will note, its actually pretty similar to the 1.17 cave update - its really cool. You can configure the sizes of the caves which is pretty neat. There are complaints of
extreme lag during pregeneration though. It only officially supports 1.10.x in its current abandoned state.

[HothGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hothgenerator.4819/) : HothGenerator is a free world generator aimed at recreating the Hoth planet from the Star
Wars movies. It was abandoned in 2016 with no supported versions listed.

[HothGeneratorReload](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/exit.69108/) : HothGeneratorReload is a fork of HothGenerator meant to continually update it and add new features
(including custom crafts and new structures). It supports 1.13.x - 1.14.x. Sadly, it's been abandoned today.

[Iris World Gen](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/iris-world-gen-the-dimension-engine.84586/) : IWG (for short) is basically a newer and better EWG. It has phemonenal looks and supports full configuration, but has lots of 
fallbacks that you should not get from a premium plugin. This includes infrequent updates, many bugs, and really slow performance.

[IslandCraft](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/islandcraft) : IslandCraft is a free but abandoned legacy (1.12 and below) world generator that spawns biomes on islands across an infinite 
ocean.

[Logaaan's World Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/logaaans-world-generator.62550/) : This was an experimental world generator with a pretty basic top area and
an underworld underneath. It only supports 1.13.x and seems abandoned.

[MaxiWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/maxiworld.11124/) : MaxiWorld is a world generator that basically just multiplies everything by 8, making each block that would
usually be 1 block be 8x8x8. Not really that useful, but still cool. It supports 1.13.x.

[MoonGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/moongenerator.62432/) : MoonGenerator is an extremely simple generator just making hills out of endstone. Cool test, not
really a proper world generator. It supports 1.13.x.

[MoonGenerator 2](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/moon-generator-2.63771/) : MoonGenerator 2 is a continuation of MoonGenerator with also basic hills of endstone. It
has ore veins, rockets, mob spawning support, and more though - not really focusing on the world generator portion. It supports 1.16.x.

[OldGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/oldgenerator-1-16-4.86600/) : OldGenerator is a fork of 173generator to bring Beta 1.7 generation to modern versions. It performs well and does what it needs, although there are reports of generation errors.

[Open Terrain Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/open-terrain-generator-otg.51373/) : OTG (for short) is a free port to Spigot of the infamous Forge mod. It allows for complete control over world 
generation, as long as you're using legacy versions as it has been abandoned.

[Paradise Island](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/paradise-land-1-8-8-1-16-x-skyworld-generator.28056/) : Paradise Island is a premium Aether generator but yet lacks everything you expect from a premium plugin. It is slow and laggy,
has a lack of support, limited features, and is infrequently updated.

[Planetoids](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/planetoids-minecraft-planet-generator-configure-every-planet-terrain-ores-and-structures.74537/) : Planetoids is a premium
world generator that just sort of pastes spheres and puts trees on top? I guess it's meant to look like many planets, but just looks like someone had fun with WorldEdit to
me. There have been complaints over bad performance too. It supports 1.13.x to 1.16.x.

[PromisedLand](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/promisedland.70884/) : PromisedLand is a plugin meant to generate sky islands like the Minecraft Sky Dimension. It is abandoned
today with support for only 1.13.x - 1.14.x. Sad as it actually looks really nice.

[RealisticWorldGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/realisticworldgenerator-1-8-8-1-16-x.15905/) : RWG (for short) is a premium world generator based on providing a realistic experience. Despite this, it is basically a 
very slow hill generator that pastes in schematics by default, although you can create your own configuration. 

[SB-Skylands](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/sb-skylands.24253/) : SB-Skylands is a fork of SkylandsPlus+ to update it to 1.8.x. - 1.11.x. It stays faithful to SkylandsPlus+
all while adding optimizations and configuarability. Sadly, it has been abandoned.

[SkylandsPlus+](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/skylandsplus) : SkylandsPlus+ is a free world generator mimicing the Minecraft Sky Dimension. It's pretty nice but has been 
abandoned for 8 years now, last supporting 1.6.2.

[Stratos](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%96%82%E2%96%83%E2%96%85%E2%96%87%E2%96%88-stratos-world-generator-1-15-1-16-5-%E2%96%88%E2%96%87%E2%96%85%E2%96%83%E2%96%82.80313/) : Stratos is a premium world generator which by default has a mystical look. It's pretty new to the market but has a good developer
actively supporting the generator. It's fully configurable, but it may run into some performance issues.

[SuraPlanets](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/suraplanets-world-generation-plugin.80052/) : SuraPlanets is a free world generator meant to recreate the Planetoids generator
for free. It doesn't really look the same to me (doesn't spawn grass/foliage often and doesn't paste in trees) but atleast it's free and supports 1.16.x.

[Terra](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/terra.85151/) : Terra is a free and open source world generator with almost vanilla generation speeds and complete configurability. It has built in 
scripting, configuration tools, and an active community working on configuration packs. A free world generator with this many features, active support, and consistent updates is unheard of before.

[TerraformGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/terraformgenerator-alpha.75132/) : TerraformGenerator is not the fastest or best looking generator, but it is free and open source. It updates frequently, but 
support may be limited.

[TerrainControl](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/terraincontrol.2214/) : TerrainControl is a free world generator allowing you to control all aspects of world generation. You
can change biome sizes, add custom biomes, control the actual generation (horizontal + vertical), and more. Sadly, its complicated and a bit laggy. It also has been abandoned,
only supporting 1.9.x.

[ToTheMoon](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/tothemoon.60390/) : ToTheMoon is a moon generator with pretty basic hills of endstone. It does have ores that spawn and custom
crafts though, not too great of a world generator alone sadly. It supports 1.8.x to 1.12.x.

[WellWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/wellworld.11125/) : WellWorld is a free world generator that generates a world divided up into regions, like in the book series
Well World. It's not really ideal for survival at all but is a pretty cool project/idea. It only supports 1.13.x.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Recommendations

Out of all of the World Generators listed here, I would recommend [Terra](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/terra.85151/) for modern versions of the game, and if you're running a 
legacy server I would recommend [Open Terrain Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/open-terrain-generator-otg.51373/) with [Biome Bundle](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/biome-bundle.51374/) due to performance and quality.
