# World Generators

One of the most sought after plugin types for new server creators are World Generators. 
A World Generator alters the way that a Minecraft World is generated, making gameplay and player experience different.
Minecraft World Generators all operate with the same idea but with different code, leading to different performance, looks, and even accessibility.

This list I am compiling here covers all of the different Minecraft World Generators I have encountered and links to them too.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A - Z

[173generator](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/b173gen) : 173generator is an abandoned free generator made to create Beta 1.7 looking terrain. The last version of it released supports 1.13.

[AlmostFlatLandsReloaded](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/almostflatlandsreloaded-1-7-1-16.55405/) : AFLR (for short) is a free and open source generator that does what it says, generating an almost flatworld with
some terrain height variation, trees, tall grass, etc. It is most useful for Creative / Building servers or possibly HCF.

[BetterEnd](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/betterend-rethink-the-end-dimension.79389/) : BetterEnd is a free (and [premium](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/betterend-premium-rethink-the-end-dimension-again.81158/)) custom world generator for the end. It is completely open source (even the Premium version!)
made by the developer of Terra. It has reached EOL and will be incorporated in a Terra config pack eventually, but it still is an amazing plugin to redefine the end dimension.

[Biome Bundle](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/biome-bundle.51374/) : Biome Bundle is a free configuration pack for [Open Terrain Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/open-terrain-generator-otg.51373/) boasting over 400 biomes and over 2000 structures. It 
isn't actively updated, but is still arguably the best generator for 1.12.

[CityWorld](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cityworld.2250/) : CityWorld is an abandoned 1.13 free and open source world generator that generates an endless city. It generates the buildings, 
roads, sewers, terrain, and more. It even has multiple different built in themes for the generation, and as far as I am aware it is vanilla friendly.

[CyberWorld Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/inactive-cyberworld-generator.36101/) : CyberWorld Generator is a free and open source futuristic city generator. It is currently abandoned and quite slow, but 
can still be potentially useful.

[Dann's Oasis Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/danns-world-generator-oasis-desert-demo-1-14-x-1-15-x-uses-an-organic-tree-generator.74083/) : DOG (for short) is a free world generator like nothing I've seen before. It is an Oasis generator (as implied) and 
manages to do that perfectly. It ever organically generates trees, it's one of the few generators I've even seen do that. Despite the amazing generation, it lacks constant updates and 
also some more performance out of the generator is desirable.

[EpicWorldGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/epicworldgenerator-1-15-1-16-5.8067/) : EWG (for short) is a premium world generator with a cult following. It's
commonly referred to as the best looking world generator, but that idea is broken down when you realize that it is a broken mess based off of a 1.6 Forge mod called
Realistic World Generator (unrelated to the Spigot one). EWG has tons of bugs, infrequent updates, and confused devs who have no idea what they're doing since it is
based off of stolen code.

[Iris World Gen](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/iris-world-gen-the-dimension-engine.84586/) : IWG (for short) is basically a newer and better EWG. It has phemonenal looks and supports full configuration, but has lots of 
fallbacks that you should not get from a premium plugin. This includes infrequent updates, many bugs, and really slow performance.

[IslandCraft](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/islandcraft) : IslandCraft is a free but abandoned legacy (1.12 and below) world generator that spawns biomes on islands across an infinite 
ocean.

[OldGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/oldgenerator-1-16-4.86600/) : OldGenerator is a fork of 173generator to bring Beta 1.7 generation to modern versions. It performs well and does what it needs, although there are reports of generation errors.

[Open Terrain Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/open-terrain-generator-otg.51373/) : OTG (for short) is a free port to Spigot of the infamous Forge mod. It allows for complete control over world 
generation, as long as you're using legacy versions as it has been abandoned.

[Paradise Island](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/paradise-land-1-8-8-1-16-x-skyworld-generator.28056/) : Paradise Island is a premium Aether generator but yet lacks everything you expect from a premium plugin. It is slow and laggy,
has a lack of support, limited features, and is infrequently updated.

[RealisticWorldGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/realisticworldgenerator-1-8-8-1-16-x.15905/) : RWG (for short) is a premium world generator based on providing a realistic experience. Despite this, it is basically a 
very slow hill generator that pastes in schematics by default, although you can create your own configuration. 

[Stratos](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%96%82%E2%96%83%E2%96%85%E2%96%87%E2%96%88-stratos-world-generator-1-15-1-16-5-%E2%96%88%E2%96%87%E2%96%85%E2%96%83%E2%96%82.80313/) : Stratos is a premium world generator which by default has a mystical look. It's pretty new to the market but has a good developer
actively supporting the generator. It's fully configurable, but it may run into some performance issues.

[Terra](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/terra.85151/) : Terra is a free and open source world generator with almost vanilla generation speeds and complete configurability. It has built in 
scripting, configuration tools, and an active community working on configuration packs. A free world generator with this many features, active support, and consistent updates is unheard of before.

[TerraformGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/terraformgenerator-alpha.75132/) : TerraformGenerator is not the fastest or best looking generator, but it is free and open source. It updates frequently, but 
support may be limited.

# Recommendations

Out of all of the World Generators listed here, I would recommend [Terra](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/terra.85151/) for modern versions of the game, and if you're running a 
legacy server I would recommend [Open Terrain Generator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/open-terrain-generator-otg.51373/) with [Biome Bundle](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/biome-bundle.51374/) due to performance and quality.
