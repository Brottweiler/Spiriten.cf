# Proxies

To handle players while sending them to another server or to allow players to join while in different versions you need to use a proxy.
On a network the proxy is as important - if not more important - than the server jar you use.

This list I am compiling here covers all of the different server proxies I have encountered and links to them too.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Server Transfer | A - Z

[Aegis](https://polymart.org/resource/aegis-the-best-bungeecord-fork.31) : A fork of BungeeCord adding many security measures and with built in anti-bot and anti-vpn. It 
supports 1.7.x to 1.16.5. The developer is currently false banned off of MC-Market.

[Avalanche](https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Avalanche) : Avalanche is a fork of Waterfall with unknown features in unknown versions. I know nothing about it other than the
fact that it was developed by the same guy who makes the PurPur server jar. It is abandoned (I think?)

[BarelyAuthenticated](https://github.com/Mindgamesnl/BarelyAuthenticated) : A fork of BungeeCord which caches players ips and usernames to verify them while Mojang services are 
unstable. It is created and mainted for the server BlockParty. Not sure of the versions, atleast 1.16.x.

[BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/) : BungeeCord is the original way to connect multiple servers together. Today it has quite a few bugs and security 
concerns. I believe it supports 1.4 - 1.16.5.

[DarkCord](https://github.com/Oculate/DarkCord) : A fork of HexaCord/BungeeCord used and made by the Oculate Network. It supports 1.7.x - 1.11.x.

[DasBungee](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/17481/) : DasBungee is a premium BungeeCord fork that adds an ip blacklist system and patches "all known exploits". It supports 
1.8.x to 1.16.x.

[FlameCord](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/13492/) : FlameCord is a Travertine fork that patches netty exploits that are harmful to BungeeCord. It supports 1.7.x to 1.16.5.

[Flexagon](https://github.com/SeaEclipse/Flexagon) : Flexagon is a fork of Hexacord and Travertine meant just for testing purposes. It supports 1.7.x - 1.16.x.

[Glymur](https://github.com/StratusNetwork/Glymur) : Glymur is a fork of Travertine adding in some bug fixes and Stratus APIs. It is developed by the StratusNetwork server.

[GoLilypad](https://github.com/LilyPad/GoLilyPad) : A rewrite of Lilypad in the programming language Go. So far no releases (?).

issues.

[GuardHexa](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/16180/) : GuardHexa is a premium fork of HexaCord that patches a lot of bugs/exploits and has a bit of optimization. It supports 
1.7.x to 1.16.4.

[HexaCord](https://github.com/CronixMC/HexaCord) : HexaCord is a bungeecord fork adding Forge support before Waterfall did. It supports 1.7.x - 1.11.x on the GitHub.

[HQBungeeCord](https://github.com/moyugame/HQBungeeCord) : HQBungeeCord is a Waterfall fork aimed at improving stability and performance. No ideas what versions it supports.

[InsaneProxy](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/16588/) : InsaneProxy is a premium fork of Travertine and Velocity, resulting in lower CPU usage and more exploits patched. It 
supports 1.7.x to 1.16.x.

[LilyPad](https://github.com/LilyPad/JLilyPad) : A seperate proxy with its own API and plugins that is most likely discontinued.

Network for any custom patches/features they may need.

[Mudslide](https://github.com/Pemigrade/mudslide) : Mudslide is a fork of Avalanche meant to continue it on. It is developed by the GitHub account Pemigrade (they run Birdflop 
hosting) with the only known feature being "support for a custom server name". I have no idea which version it supports (likely 1.16) and should note it seems abandoned.

[NachoBungee](https://github.com/CobbleSword/NachoBungee) : NachoBungee is by the guys from NachoSpigot, which scares me. On the GitHub page they list off features of what 
they forked, nothing new. Basically just Travertine I guess.

[Waterfall](https://papermc.io/downloads#Waterfall) : WaterFall is a BungeeCord fork that adds performance optimizations, bug fixes, and supports forge servers. I don't know the 
versions for it.

# Client Protocols | A - Z

[BCtrysk](https://github.com/DJIronic/BCtrysk) : A custom fork of Geyser used by the BurningCube.eu server. I believe it just adds some custom patches.

[DragonProxy](https://github.com/DragonetMC/DragonProxy) : DragonProxy was the first way to get Bedrock players on a Java edition server. Today it has fallen behind though.

[EruptionMC](https://github.com/Degagelemming95/EruptionMC) : EruptionMC is a fork of GeyserMC aimed at adding custom patches/additions as far as I am aware. It supports
1.16.4 - 1.16.5 and Bedrock editions 1.16.100 - 1.16.210. It is stressed a lot that EruptionMC is not finished.

[FloodGate](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Floodgate/) : FloodGate is an add-on to Geyser which (from my knowledge) allows your server to be in online mode while letting Bedrock 
edition mode in.

[Geyser](https://geysermc.org/) : Geyser is basically a way to allow Bedrock edition players to join a Java edition server. I believe your server needs to be an offline 
(cracked) one for it to work though.

[LoyaltyMC-pspe](https://github.com/reflykunz/LoyaltyMC-pspe) : LoyaltyMC-pspe is a ProtocolSupport fork that adds Pocket Edition support and some optimizations. It runs on 
1.13.2 and allows players in 1.4.7 - 1.13.2 Java edition to join or 1.9 - 1.12 Pocket Edition players to join.

[ProtocolSupport](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocolsupport.7201/) : Before there was ViaVersion, there was ProtocolSupport. Its quite buggy and support is quite 
lacking, but more versions can log in. Currently only works in 1.16.5, but clients 1.4.7 - 1.16.x can join using this. It is added like any other plugin like ViaVersion, 
completely plug and play.

[ProtocolSupport-Bedrock-Dev](https://github.com/Xernium/ProtocolSupport-Bedrock-Dev) : PSBD (for short) is a fork of ProtocolSupport which attempted to add Pocket Edition 
support

[ProtocolSupportPE](https://github.com/gIsForGravity/ProtocolSupportPE) : ProtocolSupportPE is a fork of ProtocolSupport which added Pocket Edition support to Java edition. It 
is currently only 1.13.2 though, but supports 1.4.7 - 1.13.x.

[ViaBackwards](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viabackwards.27448/) : ViaBackwards is an add-on to ViaVersion allowing older versions to join your server. You add it like any 
other plugin, and now people in older versions can join. It supports 1.10.x to 1.16.x.

[ViaFabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/viafabric) : ViaFabric is an implementation of ViaVersion in the Fabric mod loader. It actively supports 1.8.x - 1.17.x 
(snapshot releases of 1.17 of course) as far as I am aware. It is really cool, but can be buggy.

[ViaRewind](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viarewind.52109/) : ViaRewind is an add-on to ViaVersion allowing even older versions to join your server. You add it like any 
other plugin, and now people in even older versions can join. It supports 1.8.x to 1.16.x.

[ViaVersion](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/) : ViaVersion is a plug and play way to allow anyone on newer versions to join your server. You add it like any 
other plugin, and now people in newer versions can join. It supports 1.8.x to 1.16.x.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Recommendations

For your proxy, I personally can only recommend [FlameCord](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/13492/). It's made by a great developer with open support, has all the patches 
you need, and is free. In my opinion, an easy decision.

For client protocols, I would go with [ViaVersion](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/) and its add-ons for allowing more Java edition versions, and if you need 
to add Bedrock support go with [Geyser](https://geysermc.org/). They're both very reputable and get updates often, beating out the competition.
