# Spiriten's List of Semi-Useful Information about Minecraft Servers

What this repository is for is a place for me to compile information
about Minecraft servers that I find interesting and / or think people
should know about. This includes plugin lists, a server jar list,
and more.

If you are looking for a list of things to assist you instead of just
a list of everything I could find please check out [AnythingMC](https://github.com/Anything-Minecraft-Team/anything-minecraft/tree/main/tutorials/en_us).
